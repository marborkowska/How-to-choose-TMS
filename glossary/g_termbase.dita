    <glossdef>A termbase (TB), also known as terminology database, is a glossary of
        industry-specific and company-specific terms, which you can manage outside your translation
        memories. It is a glossary of terms in a CAT tool that you can create to be able to search
        for individual words and display them among translation results. It is useful if there are
        multiple translators working on the same project and itâ€™s important to keep accuracy and
        consistency regarding the main terms. It can be single-language or multilingual. A term base
        shows the translators which terms are new, approved, forbidden, or preferred together with
        their additional description, definition or picture. </glossdef>
