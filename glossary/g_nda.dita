    <glossterm>Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)</glossterm>
    <glossdef>It is also known as a confidentiality agreement (CA) under which the parties agree not
        to disclose any information covered by it. It is especially important when translating
        sensitive or confidential information contained in documents. Many translation vendors fail
        to properly protect their customerâ€™s information which can lead to many legal issues. You
        have a choice: to sign your NDA or your vendor's NDA. This agreement can be signed between
        the client and LSP, and between LSP and translator/reviewer.</glossdef>
