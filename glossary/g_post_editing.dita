    <glossdef>Service defined in ISO 18587:2017 as editing and correcting machine translation output
        There are two main levels of post-editing, light and full; their use depends on the purpose
        of the translation output and the clientâ€™s requirements: <ul id="ul_ivb_1kz_htb">
            <li><i>full post-editing</i> - process to obtain a product comparable to a product
                obtained by human translation</li>
            <li><i>light post-editing</i> - process to obtain a merely comprehensible text without
                any attempt to produce a product comparable to a product obtained by human
                translation</li>
        </ul></glossdef>
