    <glossterm>Localization (L10n)</glossterm>
    <glossdef>Localization is the process of adapting a product, service, advertising or any other
        content to a specific market. It should be considered different from translation because it
        actually goes way beyond. Localization requires you to convert text from one language to
        another, taking into consideration all the different factors such as: time zones,
        currencies, symbols, colours, legal requirements, website links, product beliefs and
        cultural references. The goal is to give your content the look and feel of having been
        created specifically for each target market youâ€™re aiming at.</glossdef>
