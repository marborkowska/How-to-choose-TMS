    <glossterm>Translation memory (TM)</glossterm>
    <glossdef>It is an electronic collection of source language and target language segment pairs.
        Its purpose is to facilitate the retrieval and use of previously translated content. It is a
        database of translated sentences (segments), which is created during the translation process
        [source: ISO 17100:2015 Translation services â€” Requirements for translation services]. A
        translation memory has been at the core of the industry since the late 1990s and its
        importance has not faded even with the arrival of new technologies.</glossdef>
