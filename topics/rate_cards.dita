    <title>Rate cards</title>
    <shortdesc>Rate cards make it easy to estimate costs, calculate a project's budget or choose the
        most cost-effective language vendor.</shortdesc>
    <conbody>
        <p>They are available for all XTM users from the <i>Users</i> tab and are easily
            customizable.</p>
        <p>All you need is to enter a language combination and get the following information from
            your vendors:<ul id="ul_hqg_vyx_2tb">
                <li>language pairs</li>
                <li>base rate, e.g. â‚¬ 0.10</li>
                <li>percentage rates for different categories of <xref
                        href="../glossary/g_fuzzy_matches.dita">matches</xref> (repetitions, <xref
                        href="../glossary/g_machine_translation.dita">MT</xref> matches, etc.)</li>
            </ul></p>
        <p>Here is a sample rate card for a translator:</p>
        <p>
            <fig id="fig_hvt_stk_jtb">
                <title>Sample rate card in XTM</title>
                <image href="../images/Rate%20card.jpg" id="image_ivt_stk_jtb" scale="50">
                    <alt>Sample rate card in XTM</alt>
                </image>
            </fig>
        </p>
        <p>Based on this data, XTM generates a <xref href="quotations.dita">purchase order</xref>
            automatically for a translation project as a .pdf file, which you can send to your
            vendor for approval. This automates the process and considerably shortens the
            translation turnaround time, because the quotation process can be very time consuming.
            In addition, you know exactly how much you will pay. Of course, it works well if you
            gather all this data well in advance, e.g. from the Cooperation Agreement signed with
            your vendor.</p>
