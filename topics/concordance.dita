    <shortdesc>Context is the king in translation. Here is how Concordance helps linguists make the
        most of translation resources in XTM.</shortdesc>
    <conbody>
        <p>â€œ<i>Concordance</i> involves searching all over a particular TM for translation of
            particular expression or phrase where there is no TM match (or where the match is below
            a pre-determined threshold, e.g. 75%, to be displayed), or when the translator wants to
            learn more about the context.</p>
        <p>In XTM you can run concordance search for all translation memories both from a dedicated
            panel (<i>Concordance</i> in top menu) and in <i>Workbench</i> when translating a
            document.</p>

            </fig>
        </p>
        <p>It is also good to check if the TMS you wish to buy enables search as broad, phrase or
            exact match, in both source and target segments, reverse matches (e.g. DE>EN and EN>DE
            translation memories) and for <xref href="language_variants.dita">language
                variants</xref>. As a result, you will be able to access all the language resources
            that you have collected for your company quickly and easily.</p>
